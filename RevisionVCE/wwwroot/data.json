Box 4: Azure HDInsight. Apache Hadoop was the original open-source framework for distributed processing and analysis of big data sets on clusters. The Hadoop ecosystem includes related software and utilities, including Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Spark, Kafka, and many others. Azure HDInsight is a fully managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service in the cloud for enterprises. The Apache Hadoop cluster type in Azure HDInsight allows you to use HDFS, YARN resource management, and a simple MapReduce programming model to process and analyze batch data in parallel.

What should you recommend? ", "answer": " C ", "explanation": "The question states that users are located worldwide and will be downloading large video files.  The video playback experience would be improved if they can download the video from servers in the same region as the users.  We can achieve this by using a content deliver network. A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency. Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include: Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content. Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event. Distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server. overview ", "questionNumber": 61, "section": "Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure ", "questionNote": ""}, {"questionPossibilities": ["A.
